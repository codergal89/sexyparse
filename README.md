# SexyParse - A Header-only S-Expression Parsing Library

*SexyParse* is a simple, header-only s-expression parsing library written in modern C++

## Dependencies

*SexyParse* itself has no dependencies besides a mordern(ish) C++ compiler and standard library.
The library's test suite is built using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2), which is automatically downloaded as part of the build configuration.
